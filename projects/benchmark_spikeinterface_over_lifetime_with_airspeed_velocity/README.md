# Project title:

### Key Investigators

* Heberto Mayorquin

Willing to work with anyone interested in benchmarks, willing to offer guidance or learn from someone else.

## Project Description
Some of the standard packages on the ecosystem use [air-speed velocity t]( https://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv)o benchmark the package across time. Here are two examples:

* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/scikit-learn-benchmarks/)
* [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/dev/contributor/benchmarking.html)

The idea is simple, implement the same for SpikeInterface.

### Background


### Objectives

- Create a repository with benchmarks and documentation

### Approach and Plan



Fill in with approach and project plan

 * [ ] - Discuss with main mantainers and users what are common functionalities that are expected to last in time (i.e. saving data and loading data).
 * [ ] Implement the benchmark for at least one function
 * [ ] Add another function
 * [ ] Document and 

### Progress

Fill in with tentative milestones (or leave blacnk for later):

 * [ ] Milestone 1
 * [ ] Milestone 2
 * [ ] Make PR to SpikeInterface

### Next Steps (optional)

Fill in with next steps
