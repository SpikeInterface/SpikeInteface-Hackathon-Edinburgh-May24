## Project Description

### Background

Now in spikeinterface plot_sorting_summary() use spikeinterface_gui or sortingview backend.
The first one is Qt based and work only locally. The second one push data on the cloud and then run a javascript app in the browser for visualisation.
It would be convivient to have a ligth summary viewer ipywidget directly in jupyter notebook for exploring final result with main subviews : amplitude + correlogram + units location + waveforms + ...
We already have have all this viewer but not gather in the same view.
the idea is to have a unit selector the display a quick summary for evry unit.
