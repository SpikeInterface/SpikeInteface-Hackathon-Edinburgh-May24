# Project title: Benchmarks of the sortingcomponents

### Key Investigators

* Pierre Yger
* Samuel Garcia

## Project Description

The sortingcomponents can now implement several key steps of the spike sorting pipelines in a modular and efficient manner. However, while the goal is to be able to properly benchmark all these steps, the benchmarks are not all finished and/or can be enhanced

### Background

The goal of the project is to brainstorm on the Benchmarks and write some that are currently missing (PeakSelection, MetaMerging)


### Approach and Plan

Fill in with approach and project plan

 * [ ] Write Benchmarks for Merging and PeakSelection
 * [ ] Think about the key properties/values that should be targeted in benchmarks
 * [ ] Harmonize the plots among Benchmarks to factorize code and ease the reports

### Progress

Fill in with tentative milestones (or leave blacnk for later):

 * [ ] Milestone 1
 * [ ] Milestone 2
 * [ ] Make PR to SpikeInterface

### Next Steps (optional)

Fill in with next steps
