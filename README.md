# SpikeInteface-Hackathon-Edinburgh-May24

Repo for SpikeInterface Hackathon in Edinburgh - May24

## How to submit a project?

To propose a new project, you can simply open a new issue with the `New Project` template and fill in the information.
This will automatically make a PR that creates the project folder, a `README` file with the description, and a `src `folder that groups can optionally use to collaborate.
If you want to participate to an already proposed project, you can simply add a comment to the PR of the project with your GitHub handle. 
We will keep all PRs open until the hackathon, so that all projects will be easily discoverable.
We expect every participant either propose or join a project before the hackathon, so that teams can be pre-organized.
